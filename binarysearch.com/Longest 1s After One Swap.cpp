// First go to binarysearch.com -> problems -> Longest 1s After One Swap.
/*
You are given a string s containing 1s and 0s. Given that you can swap at most one pair of characters in the string, return the resulting length of the longest contiguous substring of 1s.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s.

Example 1
Input
s = "0111011101"

Output
7

Explanation
You can swap s[4] and s[9].
