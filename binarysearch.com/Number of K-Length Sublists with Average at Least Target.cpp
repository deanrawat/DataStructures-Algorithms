// First go to binarysearch.com -> problems -> Number of K-Length Sublists with Average at Least Target.
/*
Given a list of integers nums, and integers k and target, return the number of sublists whose length is k and its average value â‰¥ target.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1
Input
nums = [0, 9, 4, 5, 6]
k = 3
target = 5

Output
2

Explanation
Sublist [9, 4, 5] has average value of 6 and [4, 5, 6] has average of 5
