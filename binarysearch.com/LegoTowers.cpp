// First go to binarysearch.com -> problems -> Lego Towers.
/*
You are given a list of positive integers heights, representing the heights of lego towers, 
and a positive integer k. You want to pick k lego towers and make them all the same height 
by adding more bricks, but using as few bricks as possible. Return the minimum number of bricks 
needed to pick k towers and make them the same height.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of heights
0 < k
Example 1
Input
heights = [4, 7, 31, 14, 40]
k = 3
Output
17
Explanation
We can pick 4, 7, and 14 which requires 17 bricks to make the same height.

Example 2
Input
heights = [4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
k = 5
