You are given a two-dimensional list of integers times where each list has two numbers [start, end], representing the start and end time of a course.

Return the maximum number of courses you can take assuming you can only take one course at a time and the start of a course needs to be later than the end of the last course.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of times
Example 1
Input
times = [
    [2, 5],
    [5, 8],
    [6, 7],
    [8, 10]
]
Output
3
Explanation
We can take these courses [[2, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10]]
